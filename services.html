          <h3>Cancellation-policy</h3>
          <p>
            Our cancellation policy at Health Naija is designed to ensure fairness and efficiency for both patients and healthcare providers. Here's an overview:<br>

Cancellation Window: Patients are encouraged to cancel appointments as early as possible to allow other patients to book the slot. Generally, appointments can be canceled up to 24 hours before the scheduled time without incurring any fees.<br>

Late Cancellations: Cancellations made within 24 hours of the appointment may be subject to a cancellation fee. This fee helps compensate healthcare providers for the time that could have been allocated to other patients.<br>

Emergency Situations: We understand that emergencies can arise, and we strive to accommodate such situations with empathy. If you need to cancel due to a genuine emergency, please contact us as soon as possible to discuss your situation.<br>

Rescheduling: If you need to change your appointment time, we encourage you to reschedule rather than cancel whenever possible. This helps minimize disruptions to the healthcare provider's schedule and ensures continuity of care for patients.<br>

Refunds: In cases where a cancellation fee applies, any applicable refund policies will be clearly communicated to the patient. Refunds, if applicable, will be processed promptly according to our refund policy.<br>

By adhering to our cancellation policy, we aim to optimize appointment availability, uphold the integrity of our scheduling system, and provide a positive experience for all users of Health Naija.
